# Claude Development Context - Command Deck Simulator

## Project Overview
A complete tactical space combat simulator built with React + TypeScript, implementing turn-based bridge simulation gameplay. The game features enemy AI, missile systems, damage modeling, and comprehensive testing.

## üìã GAME SPECIFICATIONS

**üéØ CRITICAL**: All game specifications are located in the `docs/` folder. These documents define the complete game design and must be referenced for any gameplay modifications.

### `docs/CoreSpec.md` - Game Design Document
**Purpose**: Defines core gameplay mechanics, rules, and player experience
**Contents**:
- Turn-based combat flow and phases
- Weapon systems (lasers, railguns, missiles) 
- Damage model (hull, shields, armor, systems)
- Enemy AI behavior requirements
- Player commands and actions
- Victory/defeat conditions
- Game balance parameters

### `docs/ArchitectSpec.md` - Technical Architecture
**Purpose**: Defines code structure, patterns, and technical implementation approach
**Contents**:
- Clean Architecture pattern (Domain/Application/UI layers)
- State management strategy
- Component design principles
- Testing architecture
- Technology stack decisions
- File organization standards

### `docs/TestSpec.md` - Testing Strategy
**Purpose**: Defines testing requirements, coverage goals, and quality standards  
**Contents**:
- Unit test coverage requirements
- Integration test scenarios
- End-to-end test specifications
- Test categories and priorities
- Quality gates and acceptance criteria
- Testing tools and frameworks

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Before making any changes to game mechanics, UI behavior, or architecture, consult the relevant specification document to ensure alignment with the original design intent. IF it does not align consult the user.

## Architecture
- **Pattern**: Clean Architecture (Domain ‚Üí Application ‚Üí UI)
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript 5 + Vite
- **State**: Zustand store with immutable updates
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom space theme
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Cypress (E2E)

## Key Design Decisions

### State Management
- **Critical**: All state updates must be immutable to ensure UI reactivity
- **TurnEngine**: Must create deep copies via `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(gameState))` 
- **Issue**: Direct mutation breaks Zustand's reactivity system

### Game Balance
- **Missiles**: 999km range (unlimited) for gameplay reasons
- **Movement**: Player speed 5km/t, Enemy speed 4km/t = 9km/t closure
- **Starting distance**: 30km provides tactical gameplay window

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 123 passing tests covering all domain logic
- **E2E Tests**: Cypress tests for UI integration and user workflows
- **Coverage**: Focus on domain logic, state management, and critical user paths

## Current Status ‚úÖ

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server (http://localhost:5173)

# Testing
npm test                 # Run unit tests (Vitest)
npm run test:coverage    # Run tests with coverage
npx cypress run          # Run E2E tests headless
npx cypress open         # Open Cypress GUI

# Build
npm run build           # Production build
npm run preview         # Preview build locally

# Linting & Type Checking
npm run lint            # ESLint
npm run typecheck       # TypeScript compiler check
```

### Test Running Tips
- **Unit tests timeout**: Use `timeout 30s npm test` if tests hang
- **E2E stability**: Tests may be flaky in headless mode, use `--headed` for debugging
- **Cypress waits**: Most tests use `cy.waitForGameReady()` for consistent state

## Known Issues & Limitations

### LogTabs Component
- **Issue**: LogTabs component has rendering problems in test environment
- **Symptom**: `data-testid="log-tabs"` not found in DOM during tests
- **Workaround**: E2E tests verify game mechanics without depending on LogTabs
- **Root Cause**: Likely related to `getFilteredLogs` function or useGame hook dependencies

### State Management Gotchas
- **Critical**: TurnEngine must use deep copies for state updates
- **Pattern**: `const newState = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(gameState))`
- **Why**: Direct mutation breaks Zustand reactivity ‚Üí UI doesn't update

### Test Environment
- **Build issues**: TypeScript compilation has some unused variable warnings
- **Mock complexity**: UI tests require extensive game state mocking
- **Timing**: E2E tests occasionally timeout on slower systems

  - Test appears to hang and not complete
  - Likely issue with evade button state or UI message display

- Additional tests may have issues (test run was interrupted)

#### Critical Game Functionality Issues

**üö® MAJOR ISSUE: Game May Not Function Properly**
- **Problem**: While tests show some functionality, the actual game may have runtime issues
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Dev server connectivity issues during testing
  - Some E2E tests hanging/timing out
  - Potential LogTabs component rendering problems
- **Impact**: Game may not be playable in browser despite passing some tests

#### Required Work Items

1. **üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY: Verify Game Actually Works**
   - Start dev server and manually test core functionality
   - Ensure UI loads and responds to user input
   - Verify all game mechanics work in browser
   - **Action Required**: Work with user to identify and fix runtime issues

2. **üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY: Fix Hanging E2E Tests**
   - Investigate `test-evade-fix.cy.ts` timeout issue
   - Check for other tests that may hang
   - Fix underlying issues causing test instability

3. **üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY: LogTabs Component Investigation**
   - Determine why LogTabs fails to render in test environment
   - Fix or remove LogTabs functionality
   - Update tests to not depend on broken components

4. **üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY: Dev Server Stability**
   - Investigate dev server startup and connectivity issues
   - Ensure consistent local development environment

#### Next Steps for Continuation
1. **Manual Testing**: Run `npm run dev` and verify game loads in browser
2. **Issue Identification**: Work with user to identify specific problems
3. **Systematic Debugging**: Fix issues one by one, starting with game functionality
4. **Test Stabilization**: Ensure all E2E tests run reliably

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: Do not assume the game is fully functional based on passing tests alone. Manual verification required.
